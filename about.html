		<p>Founded by two engineers, with 15 years of experience at some of the biggest companies in the world, <strong class="vb">Vantibyte</strong> provides modern tools for the modern broadcaster. Our solutions allow small broadcast teams to make output that can sit side by side with TV broadcasting.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>These days, most broadcasting isn't done by the big production studios with galleries, directors, producers, and dozens of team members for every production. It's done in bedrooms and home offices - whether it's by a twitch streamer showing their gameplay to the world - or a food blogger livestreaming the creation of their latest dish to their paid subscribers.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>This has shown that being together, physically, in one broadcasting gallery is unneeded - <strong class="vb">Vantibyte</strong> provides the tools to let your team contribute, no matter where in the world they are located.</p>
