			<p>As any organisation knows, branding is one of the most important things to make yourself recognised and maintain a strong reputation.
			At <strong class="vb">Vantibyte</strong>, that's much the same for us.<br/>
			If you wish to use any of our logos or graphics to refer to us, please get in touch first.</p>
			<p>Please do not use assets:
				<ul>
					<li>Directly from this website</li>
					<li>Found randomly on the internet</li>
					<li>Produced for others' use</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			We will happily work with you to provide graphics that suit your needs, and maintain our branding in a suitable way.
