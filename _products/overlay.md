Our overlay solution is ideal for sports and esports broadcasting. Any team member, no matter their location, can remotely change the current team names, logos, score, play animations and more.

## Example use case

An esports production company needs someone to be able to change dynamic information on the fly, like the commentators for this map, the map number, team names, their logos and the current score and play a snipe, recommending people goto their YouTube channel.

Their production aid is able to use the {% include strongblue.html text="Vantibyte" %} overlay configuration in the dashboard to change the team names, and swap the sides at half time at the push of a button. The producer using OBS doesn't have to change scene or any text on their side for them to pickup the latest information. Instead they can focus on making sure they have the right camera angles to show off the gameplay.
