Our RTMP solution (Commonly called a "restream server") allows cameras to be used from anywhere in the world, to be viewable and useable by any other team member and the final production.

## Example use case
An esports production company has only one spectator slot available in their Rainbow Six Siege game. They need to be able to share the in game camera with their casters, desk analysts and of course, the audience all in real time.

They get their in game observer to stream to {% include strongblue.html text="Vantibyte" %}'s RTMP solution. All other members on the team are able to watch it in real time, providing their commentary straight into the production desk in perfect sync with the game feed that Twitch.tv viewers see.
